### Citizen Survey Demographic Data

Each year, the City of Austin administers a Citizen Survey through a third party vendor, ETC Institue.  The purpose of the survey was to assess satisfaction with the delivery of major City services and to help determine priorities for the community as part of the City’s ongoing planning process.

A five-page survey was mailed to a stratified random sample of households in the City. Each survey packet contained a cover letter, a copy of the survey, and a postage-paid return envelope. Residents who received the survey were given the option of returning the survey
by mail or completing it on-line. Ten days after the surveys were mailed, ETC Institute sent emails and placed phone calls to the households that received the survey to encourage participation. The emails contained a link to the on-line version of the survey to make it easy for residents to complete the survey. To prevent people who were not residents of the City of Austin from participating, everyone who completed the survey on-line was required to enter their home address prior to submitting the survey. ETC Institute then matched the addresses that were entered on-line with the addresses that were originally selected for the random sample. If the address from a survey completed on-line did not match one of the addresses selected for the sample, the on-line survey was not counted.

In 2015, with the creation of 10-1 Council districts, a minimum of 200 surveys were completed in each of the City’s ten council districts. Prior to 2015, the city was divided into six geographic regions and roughly 200 surveys were completed in each of the City's six regions.

Location of Respondents:  To better understand how well services are being delivered in different parts of the City, the home address of respondents to the survey was geocoded.

To maintain participant anonymity, the survey responses were removed from the spreadsheet and only has the optional demographic information reported.
